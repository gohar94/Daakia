Open-source e-mail backup utility from POP Servers. Bare minimum features. :envelope:

## Why the need?
I couldn't find a *free/painless** utility to download e-mails from an *Outlook Web App (OWA)* account so I wrote this crude script to do the job. 

## Who will use?
A typical use case would be for backing up e-mails from expiring accounts on university/enterprise web servers. I have tried this for accounts of the following domains:
* xyz@lse.ac.uk

## Tested?
It has been *barely tested* a couple of times for an inbox size of about 6000 mails. 

## Feedback
Don't hesitate to throw in your own code or feedback on this junk.
